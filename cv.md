# **About myself:** 
  I have 5+ years of development in 1c7.7 and during my free time I got basic knowledge in Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python.
# **Code example:**
**Prime number kata from codewars in java:** Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime. Per Wikipedia, a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

```
public static boolean isPrime(int num) {
    if(num<2) return false;
    System.out.println(num);
    for(int i=2;i<=num/i;i++){
      if(num%i==0) return false;
    }
    return num>1; 
  }
```
